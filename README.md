# Computer-Graphics
In this repository, I showcase my work from CSE 457 at the University of Washington (Computer Graphics) in the Spring of 2023.
Every project was done in Unity, and the final project made use of Blender as well (to make models).

# Ray Tracing
Using ray tracing to create accurate lighting effects including reflection/refraction rays. These are some images showing this.

# Physics Simulation
Implemented custom physics - these are some videos showing it working with spheres bouncing off various objects.
